            <p>We would like to create an application for both amateur and experience photographers to find the optimal lighting, time of day, aperture, and shutter speed to capture the perfect picture.</p>
            <P>We plan on using the weather API and calculating the golden hour based on sunrise and sunset.</P>
            <p>The user will be able to input the direction of the light, input how bright the light (on a scale), and indicate which area has shade. The application will then generate tips on where to stand and what to set the apeture and shutter speed to.</p>
            <p>We will also have a page that allows the user to see what settings are needed to achieve certain effects in photography (ex. butterfly lighting, back lighting, rim lighting, hard lighting, diffused lighting) </p>
