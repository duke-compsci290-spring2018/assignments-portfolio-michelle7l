            <h3 class="title">My CS Story</h3>
            <p class="p1"> I'd like to say I remember my first interaction with a computer, but truth be told, I have a really bad memory. I probably consistenly began using the computer at age 7 when I began Kindergarten, and I do remember being obsessed with a Clifford the Big Red Dog computer game. I've since come a long way from Clifford, and I now use the computer for everything and anything, whether it be messaging a friend, watching Netflix, or coding a website (as I am now).</p>
            <p class="p1"> Having two software engineers as parents, I’ve always been determined to not follow in my parents' footsteps. I didn’t believe I fit the image of a computer scientist I had built in my head from the observations I had made at all the annual "bring your child to work" days. For me it lacked the excitement, diversity, creativity, and people interaction I craved. However, my beliefs changed when I took my first computer science class freshman year. I came to understand that computer science is much more than just robotically coding. It’s interpreting the world around you, being creative, and solving problems. It’s turning an idea in your head into something tangible. I’ve discovered a whole community of people driven by visions of how they hope to use technology to change the world around them. Specifically, I’ve found computer science to be a way for me to apply my love for creative thinking and design to address issues I’ve experienced or seen in day to day life.</p>
            <p class="p1">I chose to take this class because I want to be able to develop my designs and bring them to life. I've always appreciated beautifully designed websites, and I want to learn to create my own. In the future, I hope to use the computer as a tool to design and build products with tangible impact.</p>

                        <li><strong>Squarespace</strong> (<a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">www.squarespace.com</a>): The site has a clear and persistent call to action. The light color scheme and use of white space make it refreshingly clean and  modern. </li>
                        <li><strong>Ogilvy One Worldwide</strong> (<a href="https://www.adayinbigdata.com/">www.adayinbigdata.com</a>): The site is simple and focused. It takes a minimalistic approach and uses flat design images giving it a clean, sharp, and intelligent feel.</li>
