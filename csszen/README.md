# css zen garden pastels

In my first css zen garden, I created a fixed, full length side bar on the right. I then moved all the content left to make room for the side bar. I created a body with a margin so that the background rainbow background could be seen. I created the color changing background by using an animation feature and using five keyframes set to different colors of the rainbow. The background then repeatedly cycles through the five different colors. 

I then practiced calling on different parts of the HTML by using first child and nth child. I used the :hover function to make a few texts change colors when hovered over them. The title "CSS Zen Garden" also changes when it is hovered over. 

The archives box is a fixed box. I cleared the list style of both the resources and the archives boxed so the bullets are no longer there.
