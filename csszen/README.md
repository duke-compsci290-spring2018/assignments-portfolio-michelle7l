# css zen garden pastels

In my first css zen garden, I created a fixed, full length side bar on the right. I then moved all the content left to make room for the side bar. I created a body with a margin so that the background rainbow background could be seen. I created the color changing background by using an animation feature and using five keyframes set to different colors of the rainbow. The background then repeatedly cycles through the five different colors. 

I then practiced calling on different parts of the HTML by using first child and nth child. I used the :hover function to make a few texts change colors when hovered over them. The title "CSS Zen Garden" also changes when it is hovered over. 

The archives box is a fixed box. I cleared the list style of both the resources and the archives boxed so the bullets are no longer there.

In my second css zen garden, I used an image as the background. I then played with absolute positioning to position the title "CSS Zen Garden" and the subtitle "The Beauty of CSS Design". Hovering over these boxes will cause them to change colors. 
I then created two columns with the next two sections by applying the float: left function to both and decreasing the width of both. The clear:both separated the section titled "So What is This About from the first two sections.

In the Select a Design section, I changed the font, cleared the list style, and applied display:inline-block to each list item.  I wanted all the list items to fall in line next to one another.

The Archives and Resources menu are both fixed. I've also moved the footer to the top using display:absolute.
