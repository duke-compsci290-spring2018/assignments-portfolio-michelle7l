Began project on: 01/22/2018
Completed project on: 01/25/2018
Time spent: 7 hours

Resources I used:
[How to build a NavBar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEmysQARWFU)
[Mozilla HTML Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
[W3Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
[CSS Tricks List Style](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/list-style/)

Assets (code, images, or sounds) I used:
All code, images, and sounds were created and owned by me. 

Bugs or concerns still remaining within the site:
I wanted to learn how to implement a navbar so I created one, I have not created separate pages to link to yet, so the navbar does not link to a specific page.
