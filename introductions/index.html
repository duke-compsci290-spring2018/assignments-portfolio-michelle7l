            <p> Oh the memories of 10th grade art history class. Mrs. K would rave on and on about Picasso’s brush strokes or Rembrandt’s tasteful use of lighting while we secretly photoshopped people’s heads onto the Mona Lisa, clearly the true creative geniuses. But out of the hundreds of works of art Mrs. K dubbed as “her favorite”, Las Meninas by Diego Velazquez in all of it’s eerie glory made a lasting impression on me.</p>

            <h3 class="title"> The Inspiration </h3>
            <img src="styles/images/lasmeninas.png" alt="Las Meninas" width=710>
            <p id="source">Las Meninas by Diego Velazquez</p>
            <p> Take one look and you’ll find that most people are staring straight at you. No glares, no smiles, strictly <strong>blank, emotionless stares. </strong> Stare back and you’ll notice the effortless poise and perfection of the royal court, from the Princess of Spain perched like a china doll in the center down to the royal dog at her feet.</p>
            <p>Quite an intimidating bunch to say the least. </p>
            <p>In the 21st century, this myth of effortless perfection is still very much relevant. We encounter it day to day. Social media is a canvas on which we paint perfect lives. I think you have your life together, and you think I have mine, so we both get caught up in a strive for this unattainable goal of perfection.</p> 
            <p><strong>I want my design to instantly inspire vulnerability. </strong> I want to motivate people to open up about their stresses and their anxieties, their fears and their worries. To simply listen to one of my favorite Disney princesses and <i>let it go </i>.</p>

            <img src="styles/images/colorpalette.png" alt="Color Palette" width=710>
            <p>I selected colors from the painting to recreate the air of melodrama. After playing with different tones and shades, I decided that I wanted black and pink to be the dominant juxtaposing colors. I think they do a good job at encompassing the complexity of our feelings.</p>

            <p>I selected colors from the painting to recreate the air of melodrama. After playing with different tones and shades, I decided that I wanted black and pink to be the dominant juxtaposing colors. I think they do a good job at encompassing the complexity of our feelings.</p>
            <img src="styles/images/justbackground.jpg" alt="Just Background" width=710>
            <p>The background was added to create feelings of muddled confusion. We all need to be reminded that “I don’t know’s” and “I don’t understand’s” are part of life. Uncertainties push us to think, adventure, explore, and experience.</p>
            <img src="styles/images/allbottledup.jpg" alt="All Bottled Up" width=710>
            <p>I added the text to make sure that message was clear: Don’t keep it all bottled up. Get past the five minute conversations filled with small talk. Open up, swap stories, share opinions, explain views on life, delve into experiences, and you’ll find that those emotionless stares mask humanity. You aren’t alone in your struggles, and it’s our struggles that unite us. Lorde was right when she said we’ll never be royals.</p>
